# Bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a visualization of the use of Citibikes in New York City so that a presentation could be made to investors about a potential bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Analysis
The full Tableau story can be found by clicking [this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/noi1660/viz/NYCBikeshareChallenge_16626754778860/NYCCitiBikeReport). <br/>
Analysis of the following visualizations can return very important information. <br/>

From this it is clear that the greatest concentrations of starting station for Citibike rides is in Lower Manhattan. <br/>

When you add to that that the greatest concentrations of ending stations for ride is also in Lower Manhattan it is possible to conclude that two of the major contributions to the use of a bike share program may be, commuters, as Lower Manhattan is a location of many jobs in NYC, and/or tourism as it is also an important tourist destination. <br/>

It is also clear that the majority of rides are under 1 hour, peaking around 10-15 minutes. <br/>

Further analysis of this trend shows that the majority of these rides are by riders who identify as male and those riders also tend to take longer rides. <br/>

Looking at the user base, it is clear that not only do the majority of users identify as male, most are subscribers instead of one-off customers which implies that commuters, not tourists are the major client base for a bikeshare program. <br/>

More evidence that backs up this assumption is that the most common times for trips to happen are between 7-9am and 5-7pm, Monday-Friday, which coincides with the most common times for people to be commuting between home and work. <br/>

More evidence that the main user base is male identifying, commuter riders. <br/>

This is a visualization of the most used bikes from which one can assume that bikes that get the most use in a certain period are more likely to acquire wear and tear damage and will need to be serviced or repaired. <br/>

## Results
Based on this visual analysis several important assumptions about the success of the Citibike bikeshare program can be extracted. The first is that the majority of riders identify as male when the sign up for the program. Second, most rides are within the borough of Manhattan, as opposed to the outer boroughs, and lower Manhattan specifically. Third, based on the previous assumption and the data concerning the most common times rides happen and the average ride duration, the majority of rides are made by commuters traveling between work and home as opposed to tourists or other people exploring the city. Based on this, one can assume that the largest client base for the Citibike bikeshare program is male identifying, short distance commuters which is a demographic that will have to be studied in Des Moines, Iowa if a similar program is to be successful there.
